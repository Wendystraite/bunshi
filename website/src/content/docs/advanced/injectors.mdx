Bunshi is a [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) tool -- it creates instances of objects, classes and libraries for you on demand. The `injector` keeps track of all of those instances and stores them efficiently internally.

Most of the time you won't need to interact with the `injector` directly. It quietly works behind the scenes in the framework integrations. However, there are some cases when you may need to create your own injector to bind [molecule interfaces](/interfaces) to implementations.

## API

The core API for injectors is `createInjector`.

```ts
import { molecule, moleculeInterface, createInjector } from "bunshi";

const NumberMolecule = moleculeInterface<number>();
const RandomNumberMolecule = molecule<number>(() => Math.random());

const injector = createInjector({
  bindings: [[NumberMolecule, RandomNumberMolecule]],
});
```

Injectors can inherit from parent injectors, creating a hierarchy where child injectors can access parent bindings while adding their own:

```ts
const parentInjector = createInjector({
  bindings: [[LoggerInterface, ConsoleLoggerMolecule]]
});

const childInjector = createInjector({
  parent: parentInjector,
  bindings: [[DatabaseInterface, SqliteMolecule]]
});

// Child can access both DatabaseInterface (local) and LoggerInterface (from parent)
```
